This directory contains various `R` code used in the course. 

- You may want to run the script `install_required_libraries.R`, which installs the required libraries (and a few others used in the code in this directory).
- The example we did in class using the Euler method is in `tentative_Euler_solution.R`.
- The base SIS simulation is `simulate_ODE.R`. `SIS_ODE_several_solutions.R` does essentially the same thing, with the additional "feature" that it can plot in reverse colours as well (to make slides with a black background).
- `plot_evol_ctry_pop.R` is how I made the slide with the evolution of the Canadian population.
